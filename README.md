# kinBot
Discord bot using the new upgraded slash commands!

Uses two node apis for basic CRUD operations and some image retrieval commands. APIs are currently using Node.js, Express and Sequelize. These repos are private due to client request, for viewing access please ask!

Started in 2020 and currently updated and maintained in 2022.
Current version runs on a raspberry pi, along with the two APIs it interacts with.
